# easyheadshot
SourceMod plugin for CS:GO, redirecting any _bullet_ shot to the victim's head.

![gif of the plugin in action](https://github.com/elymination/easyheadshot/blob/master/easyheadshot.gif)

The plugin needs DHooks (https://github.com/peace-maker/DHooks2) to compile.

## In game usage
The plugin adds the console command `+easyheadshot`.
Bind the command to one of your keys (either by typing `bind [KEY] +easyheadshot` in your console or by adding a line in one of your .cfg files) or enter `+easyheadshot` directly in your console, enabling the cheats until `-easyheadshot` is then entered.

Have fun :o)
